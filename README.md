### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lukas Schmid. 

:man: Iâ€™m a former technical project manager with a strong interest in software development & tech. As a passionate hobby coder and with my previous experience within the tech industry, I love to increase my knowledge by learning new technologies and developing apps and services as an individual and within a team.

ðŸŒ± :books: During my time as a technical support representative and technical project manager, I found my passion for coding and started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on my own until late in the evenings and on weekends. 
In my free time I was building my own personal projects to increase my knowledge and learn more about full stack development. 
As a solution oriented person, the gained knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript helped me to solve tricky tasks in a short amount of time during my daily work.

:mortar_board: :rocket: With my passion to grow, diving even deeper into development and bringing my knowledge on a high professional level , I decided to apply to the full stack javascript developer bootcamp at </salt> - School of applied technology. I was one out of 20 applicants selected out of 1,200.
